# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refacto22

## My Task

This is Olga Avramenko project for EdX bootcamp. This week's challenge involved a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. 

I have refactored the code to meet standards and make it more accessible. 


###  Result

* Semantic HTML elements are found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### RTo find my code


* The URL of the deployed application -  https://elismountain.github.io/horiseon/Links to an external site. 

* The URL of the GitHub repository - https://github.com/elismountain/horiseon
